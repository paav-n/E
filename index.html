                              <p>Thanks for making your catering order at enthalpylogistics.com.

If you are not entirely satisfied with your purchase, we're here to help.To be eligible for a return of an order that can possibly result in a full refund, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it and demand for a refund can be made thirty minutes has passed from the time the catering order was meant to be delivered by. Every order comes with a digital receipt so this will be used to verify the reference point at which refund demands can be made by customers making catering orders. Your item must be in the original packaging. Proof of purchase is stored online so we will have that on record.

Applicable Incidents for Refund Payments
If an order is late due to the maestro being immensely past the intended delivery time (30 minutes or more), than the customer have a full right to request and receive a refund for the order that they placed. If a maestro arrives at the requested time of pickup, but if the order is not prepared due to the inability of the caterer (“venue”) to have it prepared on time then the burden of the order’s delay in delivery lies on the venue. However, because Enthalpy Inc.’s underlying business model focuses on optimizing the performance of small business’ catering logistics we understand that unexpected circumstances can occur and will inhibit the performance of a venue at an unfavorable time. Therefore, Enthalpy will enact a forgiveness policy where the first order that is delivered 30 minutes late from the intended delivery time, due to unfortunate circumstances from the venues, will entitle the venue to a full refund of the Enthalpy commission placed on the first order where the fault lay with the venue. Once the venue claims this forgiveness refund, which a written explanation from the venue is required to substantiate the full refund, If the fault of the order lies on the venue and or the patron being late in responding about picking up the order at the designated location than the maestro will be paid as usual without any repercussions to his or her status as a maestro. However if it is made clear from Enthalpy’s systems that the maestro was not on time to pickup an order resulting in a late order for the patron, which both the patron and Enthalpy will note, than the Maestro will be at fault be penalized in compensation unless the maestro writes an appeal explaining why they were late for the pickup of the order to begin with. If Enthalpy customer services deems that the Maestro’s reasoning is valid, and leniency will be applied for first time offenses, than the maestro will be awarded the full compensation that Enthalpy guarantees every maestro as stated in it’s business models.
